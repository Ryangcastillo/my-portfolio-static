# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in this project.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Methods
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Stateless authentication for API access
- **Session-based**: For web applications with server-side state
- **OAuth 2.0**: Integration with third-party authentication providers
- **API Keys**: For service-to-service authentication

### Authorization Model
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Users assigned to roles with specific permissions
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Dynamic permissions based on user attributes
- **Permission-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions for specific actions

### Security Headers
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Controls resource loading
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables XSS filtering

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest
- **Database Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
- **File Encryption**: User-uploaded files encrypted before storage
- **Backup Encryption**: All backups encrypted with strong keys

### Encryption in Transit
- **TLS 1.3**: All communications encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ensures past communications remain secure

### Key Management
- **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation of encryption keys
- **Key Storage**: Keys stored in secure key management systems
- **Access Controls**: Strict access controls for key management

## Input Validation & Sanitization

### Input Validation
- **Schema Validation**: All inputs validated against predefined schemas
- **Type Checking**: Strict type checking for all data inputs
- **Range Validation**: Numeric inputs validated for acceptable ranges
- **Format Validation**: Email, phone, and other format validations

### SQL Injection Prevention
- **Parameterized Queries**: All database queries use parameterized statements
- **ORM Usage**: Object-Relational Mapping to prevent injection
- **Input Escaping**: Proper escaping of special characters

### XSS Prevention
- **Output Encoding**: All output properly encoded for context
- **Content Security Policy**: Restricts script execution
- **Input Sanitization**: Removal of potentially dangerous content

### CSRF Protection
- **CSRF Tokens**: Anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **SameSite Cookies**: SameSite attribute on all cookies
- **Origin Validation**: Validation of request origins

## Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection

### Rate Limiting
- **API Rate Limits**: Per-user and per-endpoint rate limiting
- **Brute Force Protection**: Exponential backoff for failed attempts
- **Sliding Window**: Time-based rate limiting with sliding windows

### DDoS Mitigation
- **Traffic Filtering**: Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution of traffic across multiple servers
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatic scaling during attack periods

## Logging & Monitoring

### Security Logging
- **Authentication Events**: All login/logout attempts logged
- **Authorization Failures**: Failed access attempts recorded
- **Data Access**: Sensitive data access logged with user context
- **System Events**: Security-relevant system events monitored

### Log Management
- **Centralized Logging**: All logs aggregated to central system
- **Log Retention**: Secure log retention policies
- **Log Analysis**: Automated analysis for security patterns

### Security Monitoring
- **Intrusion Detection**: Real-time monitoring for suspicious activities
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular automated security scans
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Continuous compliance status monitoring

## Incident Response

### Incident Response Plan
1. **Detection**: Identify and assess security incidents
2. **Response**: Contain and mitigate the incident
3. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
4. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve processes

### Reporting
- **Internal Reporting**: Immediate notification of security team
- **External Reporting**: Responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Compliance with legal reporting requirements

## Compliance & Standards

### Security Standards
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against top web application risks
- **SANS Top 25**: Mitigation of most dangerous software errors
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management framework

### Privacy Compliance
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation compliance
- **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act compliance
- **Data Minimization**: Collection of only necessary data

## Security Testing

### Testing Types
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Code analysis for vulnerabilities
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Runtime security testing
- **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**: Combined SAST/DAST approach
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulated attacks to identify weaknesses

### Testing Schedule
- **Continuous Testing**: Security tests run with every build
- **Regular Assessments**: Comprehensive security assessments quarterly
- **Vulnerability Scans**: Automated scans run daily

## Security Best Practices

### Development Practices
- **Secure by Design**: Security considerations from project inception
- **Threat Modeling**: Identification of potential threats and mitigations
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused peer review process
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and security patches

### Operational Practices
- **Least Privilege**: Users and systems operate with minimal required permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Fail Secure**: Systems fail in a secure state
- **Regular Audits**: Periodic security audits and assessments
