# Developer Guidelines

## Code Style and Standards

### General Principles
- **Readability First**: Write code that is easy to understand and maintain
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- **SOLID Principles**: Follow object-oriented design principles

### Naming Conventions
- **Variables**: Use camelCase (`userName`, `isActive`)
- **Functions**: Use camelCase (`getUserData`, `validateInput`)
- **Classes**: Use PascalCase (`UserService`, `DatabaseConnection`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_CASE (`MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`)
- **Files**: Use kebab-case (`user-service.js`, `database-connection.py`)

### Code Formatting
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use consistent quote style (single quotes preferred)
- Add trailing commas for better git diffs

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming
- **Feature branches**: `feature/short-description`
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/short-description`
- **Documentation**: `docs/short-description`
- **Refactoring**: `refactor/short-description`

### Commit Messages
Follow the conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add JWT token validation
fix(api): resolve null pointer exception in user endpoint
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(service): extract user validation logic
test(auth): add unit tests for login functionality
```

### Pull Request Process
1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Make your changes following the coding standards
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Create a pull request to `develop` branch
6. Request code review from at least one team member
7. Address any review comments
8. Merge after approval

## Testing Standards

### Test Coverage
- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% for all modules
- **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage for authentication, authorization, and data validation
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between modules
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows

### Test Structure
```
tests/
├── unit/                 # Unit tests
│   ├── services/        # Service layer tests
│   ├── utils/           # Utility function tests
│   └── models/          # Data model tests
├── integration/         # Integration tests
│   ├── api/            # API endpoint tests
│   └── database/       # Database interaction tests
└── e2e/                # End-to-end tests
    └── workflows/      # Complete user journey tests
```

### Writing Good Tests
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear separation of test phases
- **Descriptive Names**: Test names should explain what they test
- **Independent Tests**: Tests should not depend on each other
- **Fast Execution**: Unit tests should run quickly
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Isolate units under test

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments for all public functions
- Include parameter types and return types
- Document any side effects or exceptions
- Add usage examples for complex functions

### API Documentation
- Document all public endpoints
- Include request/response schemas
- Add authentication requirements
- Provide example requests and responses

### Architecture Decisions
- Document significant architectural decisions
- Include rationale and alternatives considered
- Keep decision records in `/docs/architecture-decisions/`

## Security Guidelines

### Authentication
- Use strong, industry-standard authentication methods
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)

### Authorization
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Validate permissions at every access point
- Use principle of least privilege

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Use appropriate indexes for frequent queries
- Optimize slow queries based on execution plans
- Implement database connection pooling
- Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads

### Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use appropriate cache expiration times
- Implement cache warming for critical data
- Monitor cache hit rates and adjust as needed

### Code Performance
- Avoid N+1 database queries
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Minimize memory allocations in hot paths
- Profile and optimize bottlenecks
