## Key Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between business logic, data access, and presentation layers
2. **Testability**: Code is designed to be easily testable with proper dependency injection
3. **Scalability**: Architecture supports horizontal and vertical scaling
4. **Maintainability**: Clean code principles with proper documentation

## Technology Stack

The project is designed to work with multiple technology stacks:

- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, Go, Java, Rust
- **Frontend**: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/Azure/GCP

## Data Flow

1. **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic
3. **Data Layer**: Manages data persistence and retrieval
4. **Testing Layer**: Comprehensive test coverage at all levels

## Security Considerations

- Input validation at all entry points
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and updates
